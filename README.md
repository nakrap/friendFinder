# friendFinder
Friend Match is a Node Express app designed to match users with like interests. It functions like a dating app, but is intended for friends to meet new people by matching with others with similar interests. 

## How it Works:

Users are asked to take a quick 10 question survey, which in turn is matched up against the answers that other users in the system have answered, and will return back a result with the most compatible user. The app is coded to take in all of a new users inputs, and log them. Then compare the differences with other users, and return the result of the least amount of difference per answer. 


## Running the app locally:

1.  Start by installing all of the npm dependencies:
    - express

2. Next run the server.js file to start the server.
3. Open up the browser and navigate to localhost:8080.
4. Click on the "Go To Survey" button.
5. Fill out all of the answers.
6. Click the submit button to receive a match based on your answers.
